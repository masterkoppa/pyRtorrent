pyRtorrent
==========

A rtorrent client built using py and pyQT

Features
========

*     Connect to a rTorrent server using XMLRPC (http / https)
*     View all torrents in the server
*     Completion % of each torrent
*     Downloaded, Uploaded data and its current rate

To Come
=======

*     A GUI interface for putting the setitngs in instead of hard coded value
*     More data about each torrent
*     Other nice to have things

Plans
=====
The current plans is to make this a fully working rTorrent VIEWER. Once all
the read only things are handled then the interaction with the server will be
dealt with. But for now getting all the READ-ONLY functionality has priority.
